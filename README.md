### Hi! Happy to have you!

This collection of repositories includes personal projects that are largely inspired by people I've connected with around campus and through the world wide web, things I've learned in class, and from diving down sleep-depriving rabbit holes for hours on random technology-related topics. 

My dearest passions (right now at least) are within the realm of filmmaking technology, like virtual prodution tools (think of _Avatar_ (2009) or _Dune: Part 2_ (2024)), computer graphics (although I'm aware of how complex cg gets, and I'm barely scratching the surface through my own research), and the integration of machine learning and computer vision into visual effects. 

It's slow progress, but I tend to learn something new everyday that pushes me to take time to learn the things I'm loving and to love the things I'm learning. 

Thanks for stopping by! And feel free to contact me with any questions or "hello"s at asawicke@gmail.com. Also, check out my school-related repos @(asawicke)[https://github.com/asawicke]
